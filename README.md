# Beyond Demographics (ARR Dec'24)

This repository contains code and data for "Beyond Demographics: Fine-tuning Large Language Models to Predict Individualsâ€™ Subjective Text Perceptions". If any content in this repository is useful for your work, please cite our paper.

## DEMO dataset

The DEMO dataset is a curated and further unified collection of existing datasets. Details are reported in the paper (Link). DEMO is distributed as a CSV file in `shared_data/processed/merged_data.csv`. Code to load DEMO as we do in our experiments is contained in `multi_annotator/data.py`. **If you use DEMO in your work, please cite our paper *as well as the individual datasets*.** Below we include information on the original dataset for each task included in DEMO.
